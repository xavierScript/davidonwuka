# Personal Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website, built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It showcases my skills, experience, and projects as a Software Engineer, Web Developer, and Blockchain Developer.

This project is based on the original **vCard template** created by  
**[@codewithsadee](https://github.com/codewithsadee)** — all design credit goes to him.  
I customized and modified the template to fit my personal branding and content.

## Features

- Fully responsive design  
- Clean and modern UI  
- Sections for About, Skills, Experience, and Projects  
- Smooth animations and easy navigation  

## Acknowledgement
